# Canopus
Canopus is a mothballed Submarine Tender that was in Holyloch Scotland. Polaris Nuke loader. I am an x
Navy Electricans Mate 74 to 78.

The best I can do right now is to offer new guy suggestions regarding my troubles with writing code and 
issues I get hit with while using VS Code. What I have to say will be easy peasy for pros, maybe even 
laughable or annoying. However, I hope my words help other self starters.

The good news I have is that I pick up something new every day. The best thing I have come across is a 
huge documentation resivor called (DevDoc.io). DevDoc deals with hundreds of topics and can be downloaded
for use offline -- no internet needed; unless you follow one of the many links which take to another great
trove of information at Mozilla development.

I am used to using Microsoft Expression Web which has a nice design view so you can see where your boxes and
blocks are landing as you work. It took me a while but I did find extensions in the previewers category that give 
a decent view of whats happening. Search under (previewer of Html previewer) there is even an extension called 
{preview anything).Try to stick with extensions that have a goodly amount of stars in the rating. Great stuff, 
great application and thanks to the contributors on Git-Hub.
