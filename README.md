Submarine Tender in Holyloch Scotland. Polaris.
Right now I am a newbee and am good with Html, CSS, however need JavaScript for calculations etc.
Using Visual Studio Code and came across ReactJs.
ReactJs has an extension in VS Code called Playground and you are supposed to right code on one side
and see results in real time on the right window.
This Playground does not refresh itself. If you start another file it stays on the origional
Git Hub has a lot of info that is helping with configuration.
I also found devDocs.io on git-hub and it is loaded with info.
So at the moment I have nothing to offer except maybe a website to help others with positioning of
objects via css.
