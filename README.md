# Canopus
Canopus is a mothballed Submarine Tender that was in Holyloch Scotland. Polaris Nuke loader.

The best I can do right now (today) is try to help others new to adding javascript to html. I will
write some code and point out the most usual pitfalls I come across.

Right now I am a newbee and am good with Html, CSS, however need JavaScript for calculations etc.
Using Visual Studio Code and came across ReactJs.
ReactJs has an extension in VS Code called Playground and you are supposed to right code on one side
and see results in real time on the right window.
This Playground does not refresh itself. If you start another file it stays on the origional
Git Hub has a lot of info that is helping with configuration.
I also found devDocs.io on git-hub and it is loaded with info.
So at the moment I have nothing to offer except maybe a website to help others with positioning of
objects via css.
I am finding that many of the extensions in VS Code are not working and I am not sure if it is because
of my configuration skills involving .json files or the extension is wrong.
The JavaScript world is gigantic. npm, es6 and many other types. What I don't get is that they are all
basically the same syntax so I figure the different types are all about the level of config to get them
working.
